<p>Many years ago, Beethoven ceased being a man and became an icon—a legendary symbol of genius. This transformation began even when Beethoven was alive and is the product of the Westernized cultures with which Beethoven shared his music. Our reverence for this man goes beyond his works and extends well beyond his human qualities. Since his death, he has been called &quot;the man who freed music,&quot; the man whose voice has been lent to the hopes of oppressed people all over the world. Simultaneously, tyrants and fascists have used his music to inspire truth in propaganda, and filmmakers have underscored many dystopian futures with his music. There has not been another composer whose music has been so universally appropriated.</p>

<p>Reducing Beethoven to a mere trope is not only unhelpful but harmful for both musicians and non-musicians of the future who deserve to know who Beethoven was as close to the truth at possible. What is it about Beethoven that makes him a target of our idolatry? A growing body of literature exists which debunks the “myth of the genius,” but the mainstream culture has not taken notice to it. A combination of popular culture, exaggerated anecdotes ensconced in historical texts, and outright lies has formed our collectively romanticized view of Beethoven as a god. Even J.S. Bach—someone who was much more prolific as a composer and whom Beethoven looked up to—does not have this god-complex surrounding him in our culture.</p>

<p>This annotated bibliography is a combination of biographies; articles in musicology, philosophy, and literature; and translated primary sources (correspondences and conversation books) which illuminate the human that was Ludwig van Beethoven. This bibliography focuses exclusively on material that addresses the myths surrounding Beethoven from the hundreds, if not thousands, of books, articles, and dissertations on Beethoven.</p>

<p>The bibliography is organized into three sections. The first section focuses on materials that directly discuss the myth itself, helping the reader identify the specifics of the myth and its origins. There is not much written on this topic, so the state of literature remains incomprehensive. For this reason, the second section is extensive. The second section gathers resources that will help the reader understand how the myth came about by extensively investigating the rhetoric and reception of Beethoven during and after his life. The third and final section gathers resources that will help the reader acquire a more faithful view of Beethoven, the man. If a resource includes blatant fiction (i.e. a story that would have been impossible based on conflicting accounts), the annotation will describe why the resource is listed at all.</p>

<p>Discerning truth from fiction is often difficult if not impossible altogether. Sometimes, objective truth can’t be reached due to missing information or too many false accounts. Many of these stories are told decades after-the-fact or on the storyteller’s deathbed, so these stories must be scrutinized and taken with much skepticism. My intent is to offer resources that will help the interested reader learn much about who Beethoven was and tell truth from fiction. I hope that such a bibliography will help everyone to be better informed of the person that was Ludwig van Beethoven and will keep his legacy as close to the truth as possible.</p>

class=SpellE>Keiler</span> provides concise but ample evidence why this

class=SpellE>Knittel</span> discusses the general form that different
&quot;first meeting with Beethoven&quot; myths take in exhaustive detail. <span
class=SpellE>Knittel</span> offers the shining example of such a story: the
story of Liszt’s first meeting of Beethoven as a child prodigy. <span
class=SpellE>Knittel</span> explains that through research, Liszt's story was
proven to be impossible. <span class=SpellE>Knittel</span> asserts that these
stories first begin with the desire to seek the master, gaining entrance after
numerous setbacks, receiving positive response from the master only to run into
communication barriers, and finally the possibility of more meetings and how
life-altering the meeting was. <span class=SpellE>Knittel</span> catalogues at
least 18 of such stories by Rossini, Liszt, and <span class=SpellE>Spohr</span>
among others. Furthermore, the possible motives for fabricating these stories
are discussed such as the fact that by placing themselves in this holy
experience, they elevate themselves. His classification of the pilgrimage story
structure and the cataloguing of different stories and which structural
components they contain is a very helpful overview. This is an essential
reading to understanding the forms and the origins of the Beethoven myths.</span></p>

considers the ramifications of &quot;serious music&quot; in the
nineteenth-century German nationalism movement. More specifically, Applegate
discusses how both the musical and scientific disciplines in Germany adopted
the idea of nationalism. Among the many consequences of this adoption was how
the German musical culture evaluated &quot;what music was excellent and what
not.&quot; The musical establishment (critics like E. T. A. Hoffmann) crowned
Beethoven its king—a central voice to their young German national identity.
Without a doubt, the nationalism movement in nineteenth-century Germany was one
of the most consequential movements in recent history, and by understanding why
that movement used Beethoven as their main voice, we can better understand how
that movement affected the reception of Beethoven in nineteenth-century Germany
and beyond.</span></p>

discuss the history of the German identity as it relates to music. They devote
a section of the essay to the role Beethoven played in shaping the culture.
They note that Beethoven had greater interest in the politics (especially of
the revolution and restoration) than any other composer before him. Speaking of
19th and 20th century politicians (from the courts of Frederick William II to
the Third Reich), they write &quot;it was Beethoven in particular who mattered
to politicians of all stripes, especially in his heroic mode.&quot; There is no
doubt that political forces' use of Beethoven is partly responsible for his
status as a demigod in our current society, and this overview of the evolving
German national identity and music's role in it is both a helpful and an
important read.</span></p>

lifetime but also acknowledged to the full in the years since his death.&quot;
In the end, they conclude that &quot;we doubt whether Beethoven the musician
can be divorced from Beethoven the political figure.&quot; It is imperative to
understand that Beethoven means different ideas to different people and the
synthesis of all those thoughts are complex. Only by discussing the different

lowest form of music to the highest. To Bonds, the greatest weapon in the new
aesthetic was Beethoven, especially with his fifth symphony. He describes the

with which Bowie paints how quickly aesthetics evolved at the turn of the 19th

&quot;during this period music without words changed for many thinkers in
Europe from being a subordinate form of art to being the highest form of
art.&quot; He attributes this change to &quot;the widespread questioning, in
philosophy and elsewhere, of the idea of thought as exclusively a
representation of what is already there in the world.&quot; Being from Bonn,
one of the large centers of Enlightenment ideals, Beethoven was intimately
interested in philosophy, and understanding the move away from the Age of
Enlightenment into Romanticist thought is important to understanding both
Beethoven's own influence in the aesthetic change as well as how he was
influenced by it.</span></p>

traditional formal practices, duration, and musical gesture. This shift from tradition
was initially not well-received by many critics. The critics of the Third
Symphony likened the suddenness of events as following &quot;the same
principles as the rhetoric of the Revolution.&quot; At least in one example, it
took three years for an anonymous author to praise the symphony in the main
newspaper of their time, Leipzig's <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

traces the evolution of Beethoven's reception in the United States. He
describes the reception like a tree. Initially, it began with the trunk and
Beethoven meant a very specific thing to Americans. As time went on, the trunk
diverged into different branches and different groups of people began to
incorporate Beethoven and his music into their lives in diverse ways. Broyles
highlights the special influence the Transcendentalists had on Americans with
their veneration of the composer. Broyles concludes that Beethoven was
&quot;all but deified and considered a moral being beyond mere mortals&quot; by
the early 20th century. <span class=SpellE>Broyle's</span> scholarship is
thorough and recent, and this book's comprehensive perspective on the American
reception shows that Beethoven was deified even outside of the context of the
evolving German culture which seemed destined to deify Beethoven.</span></p>

closely examines four specific times to find any ebbs and flows in the
reception of Beethoven: 1827, 1870, 1927, and 1970 which are all the dates
related to Beethoven's birth or death. These dates represent the times when musical
institutions celebrated Beethoven more than usual, and therefore, when the
language about him becomes the grandest. By tracing how the language has
changed over the years at their most dramatic points, Burnham observes four
different <span class=SpellE>Beethovens</span> that all have superhuman
characteristics in some fashion. For example, the literature in 1927 saw
Beethoven &quot;as lawgiver and the bearer of Classical values.&quot; By

dissertation explores the rise of Beethoven's reputation in the United States

and quixotic: in 1819, the first Beethoven society of anywhere in the world
began in Portland, Maine while in 1823, Beethoven was rarely performed in
Boston. From there, she traces the rise of Beethoven's reputation in the United
States by identifying the earliest published articles in America of Beethoven.
She also credits the work of John Sullivan Dwight and Alexander Wheelock Thayer
as the primary drivers of familiarizing Beethoven to Americans. It is
interesting to look at Beethoven through the lens of a curious 19th-century
American. Understanding how he became renown in America gives us clues to how
his mythic identity formed in Europe.</span></p>

makes the case that Beethoven to Germans of the last century is highest symbol
of unity, pride, and achievement. He makes it clear that Beethoven wasn't
always received this way in politics: in the decades after his death, Beethoven's
music was accused of upholding French values and a threat to the German
government by spreading ideas of a revolution along with liberty, equality, and
fraternity. Dennis goes on to show how the political reception of Beethoven's
music evolved to become a symbol of German unity and nationality—something that
would have been impossible to consider in 1849. Because cultural reception and
political reception are two different things, it's essential to note the
differences between the two—which for Beethoven were wildly different.</span></p>

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ninth Symphony</i> to show how &quot;by the
time of the concert, Beethoven's supporters in the music press were primed to
publish rave reviews.&quot; What happened was that Beethoven—who had initially
planned for the premiere of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ninth</i>
to be in Berlin or London—changed the location to Vienna after prominent
Viennese and his patrons published their signed petitions in the city's
newspapers. Mathew asserts that the music press was self-conscious and biased
to manufacture Beethoven's success because of his decision to honor their
demands. They deemed it a &quot;historic&quot; event even before it was over.
It is imperative to understand the public's predetermined bias in making
Beethoven their success because it explains how Beethoven became more than just
a composer who would normally be at the mercy of the audience and the critics.</span></p>

asserts that the &quot;concert life in Vienna during the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries has not always enjoyed the best of reputations.
Especially in comparison with the German capitals and London, where
professional and amateur subscription series dominated the musical scene and
provided a steady supply of performances.&quot; This is to mean that while
Vienna was rich in music, publicly concertizing as an orchestra was not as
established as it were elsewhere. Rather, private concerts—like the ones of the
aristocracy and the nobility—of both symphonic and chamber music was much more
widespread. In examining comprehensive sources, including histories of public
concert locations, orchestra sizes, and mentions in the publications along with
many other sources, Morrow makes a distinction of the year 1810 when the
Viennese concert life began a new era. The fact that this date is placed
approximately between the premieres of Beethoven's <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Fifth</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Seventh Symphonies</i>
is not a mere coincidence along with his rising stature as a master composer.
In understanding the transformation of Vienna's public music life is essential
to understanding how Beethoven became cemented in their music scene, and for
that matter, ours.</span></p>

with the political concept of freedom. She refutes the idea that Beethoven has
always represented the values of freedom since his emergence as a composer—a
notion that is so firmly ingrained in our culture today that Beethoven's music
is almost exclusively used to commemorate tragedies and celebrations of human
triumph (the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11 among others). In tracing the
history of how Beethoven's music became to represent freedom, she discusses how
popularized anecdotes such as Beethoven ripping out the title page of the <i

Napoleon betrayed the ideas of the Revolution and liberty were only made known
after Beethoven's death—and therefore, likely false. It's important to

the contemporaneous understanding of Beethoven during his own time. Pederson's

collective consciousness. In this discussion, Spitzer focuses on musical
metaphors, especially within the structure of tonality that the Western culture
has developed in the last few centuries. Furthermore, he discusses implications
of rhythmic structure and the grammar of melody. He draws a prosodic connection
between these metaphors and the works of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. While
Spitzer does not spend extended amount of time discussing Beethoven, he does
draw a parallel between Beethoven's compositional processes and the importance
of melody, a form of musical metaphor. In understanding Beethoven, the
composer, through the lens of metaphors in harmony, rhythm, and melody, we can

<i>Beethoven</i> is not so much a biography as it is an essay on aesthetics and
the hegemony of German culture. Wagner makes a detailed discussion of
expression in music and drama, the relationship between an artist and the
state, and universality of music among other topics. These discussions occur
all through his observations of music by Beethoven. As it might be expected of
Wagner's writing, there is an undeniable strain of nationalism, especially near
the end of the book when he attacks French culture and the importance of German
music in his utopian ideals. Allen writes of Wagner: &quot;the figure of
Beethoven as seen from such a lofty Wagnerian summit is not only inextricably
linked with the victories of 1870 but is cast as a cultural pillar of
Bismarck's emerging German Reich.&quot; Wagner gives us a glimpse of
Beethoven's role in the German culture in the rapidly shifting political
landscape of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. With it, we can better

every-day music critics, even those who didn't consider Beethoven to be

universally, recognized [Beethoven] as a composer of genius, and this recognition

discusses the trajectory of the concept of depth in German aesthetics from 18<sup>th</sup>-century
geology to Schoenberg's twelve-tone compositions. Watkins proposes that the
common notion that Beethoven's music speaks to the inner-most of our souls
began with E. T. A. Hoffmann's writings on Beethoven. Watkins places Hoffmann's
reception (and the public's agreeance) firmly in her trajectory of the concept
of depth in German culture. She expands this by noting A. B. Marx's ideas of
musical depth &quot;a concept he too reserved especially for the works of
Beethoven.&quot; By showing how the German culture was attuned to the concept
of depth, Watkins details how the German public was attuned to the music of
Beethoven, especially given the positive reception by Hoffmann and Marx. Understanding
this aspect of depth in German culture is a non-trivial aspect of understanding
how Beethoven became cemented in our culture today as an icon.</span></p>

assembles important documents and events of the 19th and 20th century and
writes about them (as well as including the translated primary documents) to
describe a path Europe took from the Romanticism movement to the philosophy of
Existentialism. Especially in Gordon Wright's essay on Romanticism, he
describes the different facets of Romanticism from literature to music. By
understanding the attitudes and cultural aspirations of Romanticism, we can
better understand the context in which Beethoven was made a hero and how his
narrative was ripe for promulgation to not only Germans but for all Europeans.</span></p>

article by Albrecht is a comprehensive resource on the history and provenance
of Beethoven’s conversation books. It discusses in fine detail how Anton
Schindler, Beethoven’s unofficial secretary and biographer, fabricated stories

recent era are working to unravel. However, unlike the article by <span

bad as the last 50 years of musicology made him out to be. Because Schindler’s
biography of Beethoven is one of the oldest and most renown, being aware of
Schindler’s “notorious propensity for falsification” is critical to
successfully separating truth from fiction in regards to understanding who was

are very literal without overt editing by Albrecht (in direct contrast to Emily

offers a comprehensive <span class=GramE>look into</span> the way in which the
German culture—and in many ways, its identity as a nation—is closely associated
with the music of Beethoven, perhaps more than any other composer. He traces
the different eras of Germany from before it was a unified nation to after the
fall of the Berlin wall. He identifies the political environment of Germany in
those periods and aims to identify how Beethoven’s music was co-opted for
different purposes including both extremes of the political spectrum from the
far-left to the far-right. Dennis asserts that because Beethoven has been an
ideological symbol for political and cultural agendas of all kinds in Germany
for a long time, many narratives have been spun for different purposes. He
identifies these myths and political reshaping of Beethoven from a
comprehensive analysis of many media sources from scholarly writings to radio
transmissions. This thorough study of the cultural appropriation of the
Beethoven narrative will help peel away the layers of fiction surrounding

musical world in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Examining Beethoven's musical
inheritance is important not only to gain an understanding of his musical style

reexamines one of the most complicated and dramatic parts of Beethoven's life:
his relationship with his nephew. Even in Beethoven's day, there were
conflicting accounts and mixed feelings about Beethoven's handling of the
situation. Solomon takes no sides and only acts to bring a fuller context to
the story than any other source before it had. He uses psychological and
economic approaches to determine why Beethoven acted the way he did, and
through this work, we are not only able to better understand Beethoven's
puzzling actions regarding his nephew but his <span class=GramE>character as a

provides a comprehensive financial condition of the household in which
Beethoven grew up. He makes the case that the Beethoven household was not one
of destitute poverty as many in the past (including the great Thayer) have
claimed. Part of the hero-complex which Beethoven has achieved comes from the
imagery of him rising out of poverty. In refuting this myth, Solomon asserts
that Beethoven grew up in a modest home, if not with comfort. They were not
wealthy by any measure, but the stories of his family having to pawn their
possessions for food are proven to be false. Solomon aggregates surviving court
documents, accounting books, letters, and known inheritance from Beethoven's
grandparents to estimate approximate household income and discusses what it
would have meant at the time based on what we know of the costs of living in
Bonn. In addition, Solomon provides evidence that the young Beethoven also
worked with (and sometimes without) pay as an organist, composer, and chamber
musician as a teenager which contributed to the family's bottom line. It's
important to accurately understand the financial picture of the Beethoven
family <span class=GramE>in order to</span> assess what is myth and what is
not.</span></p>

combs through documents of Beethoven—letters, conversation books, and
annotations he made in books—among other sources to trace a history of
Beethoven's thoughts on evolving aesthetics of his own and others' works. He
summarizes Beethoven’s own observations of his struggle as an &quot;antagonism
between spiritual and material spheres.&quot; He also depicts an artist who was
human in that delight and wonder often overpowered his resolve for reason and
virtue. Although Beethoven could be quite stubborn, he acknowledged his own
internal development &quot;which roughly parallels the evolution of ideas
coming into play against the backdrop of the Habsburg [Enlightenment], the
French Revolution, the Napoleonic Era, and the post-Congress of Vienna
years.&quot; By understanding Beethoven's own awareness of his ever-changing
aesthetics as an artist, we <span class=GramE>are able to</span> better grasp how
he—like all other artists—was human, not a myth.</span></p>

Beethoven that the myth presented: &quot;in his person rough, crude, and

one that the myth hasn't reinforced for the last 200 years. Beethoven, like

Wheelock Thayer's biography of Beethoven is by far the most widely accepted
Beethoven biography written in English. Thayer, an American, scoured court
records, notices, Beethoven's own documents, and &quot;reminiscences from
anyone he could visit who had been in any way associated with Beethoven or had
personal recollection of him.&quot; Thayer's biography is widely accepted
because it stays away from wild theories or sensationalist writing. Thayer
himself stated: &quot;I fight for no theories and cherish no prejudices; my
sole point of view is the truth<span class=GramE>. . . .</span> I have resisted
the temptation to discuss the character of his works and to make such a
discussion the foundation of historical speculation.&quot; In the late 1800s,
Thayer published three volumes comprising of his biography of Beethoven up to
the year 1816. He died in 1897 before completing the volume on the last decade
of Beethoven's life. Forbes' edition takes the work of <span class=SpellE>Krehbiel</span>
(who first completed Thayer's biography using his manuscripts) and updates it
with new research and translations. In getting to know Beethoven, the man,

Webster's article makes the case that most of what is written about the nature

He then paints a comprehensive picture of the relationship based only on

notion that Beethoven felt superior to Haydn as a composer&quot; with evidence
