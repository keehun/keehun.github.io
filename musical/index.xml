      <description>The Tenth Symphony marked a big return for Dmitri Shostakovich, who had been suffering from a denunciation by the Soviet government, whose officials were against all music, art, and literature that they considered too abstract, formal, and serious. Along with Sergei Prokofiev, Aram Khachaturian, and other artists, Shostakovich was denounced in 1948 for writing “non-Russian” music. He had already been denounced once before in 1936 from which he recovered by composing his Fifth Symphony.</description>

      <description>Many contemporaries of Brahms considered him to be the true successor to Beethoven. Because of this lineage, Brahms faced extremely high, if not unrealistic, expectations for his First Symphony. It would be on the basis of this symphony that many judged whether or not Brahms was the true successor of Beethoven. Who could manage to follow the Ninth Symphony’s grand musical gestures, its infinite horizon of musical depth, and its epic hope for joy and unity among the brotherhood of Mankind?</description>

      <description>Program notes written for Ithaca College Symphony Orchestra&amp;rsquo;s concert on February 5, 2017.
Piano Concerto in A minor, op. 16 (Grieg) Grieg was only 24 years-old when he composed this concerto—the only concerto he completed in his life. It was premiered in Copenhagen on April 3, 1869, and a months later, it was premiered in his own country in Oslo, Norway. Like many composers before him, Grieg never quite finished the work, revising it throughout his career until he died.</description>

      <title>The Beethoven Myth: An Annotated Bibliography</title>

      <description>Many years ago, Beethoven ceased being a man and became an icon—a legendary symbol of genius. This transformation began even when Beethoven was alive and is the product of the Westernized cultures with which Beethoven shared his music. Our reverence for this man goes beyond his works and extends well beyond his human qualities. Since his death, he has been called &amp;quot;the man who freed music,&amp;quot; the man whose voice has been lent to the hopes of oppressed people all over the world.</description>

Polovtsian Dances Alexander Borodin is one of the most interesting composers. He was not only a widely respected organic chemist in his day (he is co-credited with the discovery of the Aldol reaction) but he also composed one of the most famous Russian operas (Prince Igor), adopted children, and was an activist for women’s rights (especially in equal education).</description>

Semiramide (1823) While it’s accepted that many old tales have become inconsistent over the years, Semiramis is in her own class when it comes to the sheer number and diversity of variations. The version Rossini chose to write about in his last Italian opera comes from Voltaire’s tragedy Semiramis.
There are threads of consistency among the plethora of different versions.</description>

Debussy: Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun is one of Debussy’s most revolutionary pieces. Pierre Boulez said of the piece that it “brought new breath to the art of music.” Debussy said of his own work that: The music of this prelude is a very free illustration of Mallarmé&amp;rsquo;s beautiful poem.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Introduction of Musical Rhetoric</title>

      <description>Introduction The skill of rhetoric and the pursuit to achieve it has been one of the most coveted in all of recorded human history perhaps only secondary to the pursuit of love and happiness, or to find the meaning of life. From every powerful men who have conquered various corners of the earth to the witches who have seduced them, rhetoric has been at the core of their success. If it wasn’t for the idea and the study of rhetoric, the Socratic Dialogues or Homer’s Iliad may have no influence on us today, and the geo-political boundaries may look completely different.</description>

      <title>The Relevance of Philosophy for a Musician</title>

      <description>This essay is the written corroboration of the self-transformative process regarding my views on abstract branches of Philosophy such as metaphysics and ontology. So far, I have ignorantly dismissed them as irrelevant. However, taking this course on Continental Philosophy has taught me that it is not as irrelevant as it initially seems. This essay, in its current form, reflects the status of my thought at the time of my writing.</description>

      <description>With the recent passing of Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s decision to allow re-copyrighting of Public Domain works, Congress will pass a legislation that will implement just that&amp;ndash;in order to satisfy their lobbyists&amp;rsquo; deep pockets. This is the single worst decision and piece of legislation I&amp;rsquo;ve ever came across. It is more ridiculous than SOPA or PIPA.
In a form of protest, I am releasing a piece of music that should be in the Public Domain by now.</description>
